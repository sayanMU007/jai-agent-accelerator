## Product: Jai's Agent Accelerator

### Product Name
Jai's Agent Accelerator

### Tagline (Short Description)
The production framework that took 6 failed agents to build. Now you get it in an afternoon.

### Long Description

---

## 1. HOOK (Unspoken Truth)

**I wasted 4 months building AI agents the wrong way.**

Copy-pasting prompts from Twitter. Hacking together "ChatGPT wrappers" that worked in demos and collapsed in production. Staying up until 2am debugging context windows. Starting from scratch every single time.

Then I realized: nobody teaches you the *architecture*. They teach you prompts.

---

## 2. PROBLEM → AGITATION

**The gap between "cool demo" and "real product" is killing AI projects.**

| Where you are | Where you need to be |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Copy-pasting prompts that work "sometimes" | A production system users actually rely on |
| Generic outputs needing 45 minutes of editing | Structured outputs ready to ship |
| Stuck on localhost for months | Deployed and collecting real usage data |
| Starting from scratch with every project | A reusable framework for any domain |
| "It works on my machine" | 4 deployment paths that actually work |

You've taken the courses. You've watched the YouTube tutorials. You've even built something that impressed your colleagues in a demo.

But when it's time to ship something real? Something that handles edge cases, scales with users, and doesn't hallucinate your company into a lawsuit?

You're stuck in the same loop I was in.

---

## 3. SOLUTION (The Breakthrough)

**I built the framework I wish I had when I started.**

After 6 failed agents and 2 years of teaching non-technical people to ship AI that works, I distilled everything into a production system. It's the exact architecture I use for every agent I build now.

The secret? **Mixture of Experts methodology.** Not one monolithic agent trying to do everything, but specialized tools working together. The same pattern that powers Claude, Gemini, and every serious LLM in production.

This isn't a prompt collection. It's an *architecture*.

---

## 4. OFFER (Fascinations)

**What's inside Jai's Agent Accelerator:**

• The "Mixture of Experts" architecture that took me 6 failed agents to figure out — now you see it in 5 minutes of reading the methodology docs

• 15+ production-ready tools across 4 categories (intake, research, planning, risk) you customize, not build from scratch

• A React frontend with streaming that ACTUALLY connects to your FastAPI backend — the integration nobody explains properly

• The 5 operating modes that let you ship focused features instead of a monolithic agent trying to do everything

• 4 deployment paths with step-by-step guides (Netlify, Docker, Railway, Vercel) — because "it works on my machine" isn't production

• 2,000+ lines of methodology docs grounded in 10 practitioners: Moore, Christensen, Dunford, Maurya, swyx, Harrison Chase — not made-up frameworks

• The exact prompt patterns I use for structured outputs that don't need 45 minutes of human editing

• Human-in-the-loop workflow architecture — because fully autonomous agents aren't ready for high-stakes work

• MIT licensed. Use it for clients. Build products. Sell what you create.

---

## 5. WHO THIS IS FOR (Qualification)

**This is for you if:**

• You're a PM, founder, or technical professional who wants to ship AI that works — not collect another course certificate

• You can read Python and follow terminal commands (you don't need to be a senior dev)

• You're tired of starting from scratch every time you have an AI idea

• You want to make progress without staying up past midnight debugging

• You're ready to invest in a framework, not just watch tutorials

**This is NOT for you if:**

• You want someone to build it for you (I have consulting for that)

• You need a no-code solution

• You just want prompts to copy-paste (that's why you're stuck in the first place)

---

## 6. CREDIBILITY (Borrowed Authority)

**The methodology isn't made up.** It's grounded in:

| Practitioner | Contribution |
|--------------|--------------|
| Geoffrey Moore | Crossing the Chasm positioning |
| Clay Christensen | Jobs to Be Done framework |
| April Dunford | Obviously Awesome positioning |
| Ash Maurya | Running Lean validation |
| swyx | AI Engineering patterns |
| Harrison Chase | LangChain/LangGraph architecture |
| Anthropic Team | Human-AI collaboration patterns |

These aren't just names on a page. The methodology docs show exactly how each framework informs the agent architecture.

## 7. ABOUT THE CREATOR

**Jai Bhagat** — Agent Engineer & Educator

I've analyzed 14,208 AI outputs and found a 29.1% failure rate across enterprise workflows. That research led me to build PM AI Lab, where I teach non-technical professionals to ship AI that works.

**My credentials:**

• Professional Agent Engineer specializing in LLM observability & evaluation

• 2 years teaching AI to people who'd never opened a terminal

• Built production agents across PMM, GTM, learning design, and business analysis

• QEDC-validated methodology with measurable business outcomes

• Contributor to the LangChain ecosystem

**My research:** [pm-ai-lab.netlify.app](https://pm-ai-lab.netlify.app)

---

## 8. GUARANTEE (Risk Reversal)

**30-Day "Ship It or Return It" Guarantee**

If you can't get a working agent deployed within 30 days of purchase, email me for a full refund. No hoops. No "prove you tried" nonsense.

I'm confident because the framework works. But I know buying a $497+ template feels risky. This removes that risk.

*The only thing you risk is staying stuck.*

### Day 3: Getting Started Check-in

**Subject:** How's your agent coming along?

Hi {name},

It's been a few days since you got access to the Agent Accelerator.

Quick check-in:
- Have you gotten the agent running locally?
- Any blockers I can help with?

If you're stuck, reply to this email. I read every message.

**Quick tip:** The fastest path to a working agent:
1. Start with the default PMM agent
2. Make one small change to the prompts
3. Deploy to Netlify (free tier works fine)
4. THEN customize for your domain

Most people try to customize too early. Get it running first.

### Day 14: Case Study Request

**Subject:** Quick question about your agent

Hi {name},

Two weeks in — I'm curious how it's going.

Have you shipped anything yet? Even a prototype counts.

If you've got something working, I'd love to hear about it. The best examples become case studies (with your permission) and help future builders.

Just reply with a few sentences about:
- What you built
- Who it's for
- What made it work (or not)

— Jai

## FAQ (Objection Handling)

**"Do I need to know how to code?"**
You should be comfortable reading Python and following terminal commands. If you've ever run `pip install` or cloned a GitHub repo, you're ready. This isn't a no-code solution — it's a *fast-code* solution.

**"What if I use OpenAI/GPT-4, not Claude?"**
The template defaults to Claude because that's what I use in production, but the architecture is model-agnostic. The LangChain layer means you can swap models with minimal changes.

**"How much will API costs be?"**
Expect $30-50/month at typical usage. The cost optimization guide (included in Pro) shows you how to keep costs under $50/mo even with heavy usage. The patterns in the methodology docs are designed to minimize token waste.

**"Can I use this for client work?"**
Yes. MIT licensed. Build products, deliver client projects, sell what you create. That's the point.

**"What if it doesn't work for me?"**
30-day money-back guarantee. If you can't get a working agent deployed in 30 days, email me for a full refund. No hoops.

**"What's the difference between tiers?"**
- **Starter ($497):** Framework + docs. For self-starters who learn by doing.
- **Pro ($997):** Framework + 5 hours of video + office hours. For people who want to understand the *why*, not just copy the *what*.
- **Team ($1,997):** Framework + video + direct access (Slack, onboarding call, roadmap reviews). For teams building a shared capability.

**"When does the cohort course start?"**
January 27, 2025, on Maven. The course is sold separately but includes Accelerator access. Pro tier members get waitlist priority.

**"Is this just a prompt collection?"**
No. Prompt collections are why you're stuck. This is an *architecture* — a production system with 15+ tools, structured outputs, deployment automation, and human-in-the-loop workflows. The prompts are part of a system, not the whole product.

## Pricing Psychology Notes

**$497 (Starter):**
- Below $500 threshold (feels more accessible)
- Positions as "serious tool" not "$99 template"
- Comparable to premium Tailwind/SaaS templates

**$997 (Pro):**
- Just under $1,000 psychological barrier
- 2x Starter = clear value upgrade
- Video content justifies price jump

**$1,997 (Team):**
- Standard "3 seats" SaaS team pricing
- 1-hour call = high perceived value
- Slack channel = ongoing relationship

**Anchor effect:** Team price makes Pro look reasonable. Most sales will be Pro tier.
